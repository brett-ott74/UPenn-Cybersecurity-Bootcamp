The Lucky Duck Casino suffered major losses over the course of three separate days. The dates when
when the major losses occurred were March 10th, 12th and the 15th.  There was a consistent pattern
of times of the day, primary dealer and a certain player for each instance of a major loss.
The losses occurred at 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm on each of the three days.  Dealer Billy Jones was the only
dealer to be working during each of those times for a total of 15 shifts during a major loss over the three days.  
Mylie Schmidt was the only player who played during each of the times a major loss occurred. The fact that 
Billy Jones was the dealer during each major loss and that Mylie Schmidt was a player during each major loss is more than a coincidence. 
I assess they were working together to scam the Lucky Duck Casino and rig the roulette game to their advantage.
